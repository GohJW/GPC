## Motivation 

When youâ€™re bored and have nothing better to do on a rainy day, what else can you do other than watch your favourite k-dramas, take a nap, or just study even harder for your modules?

Playing games is a good alternative that can entertain and pass your time effectively. Some games are just for pure entertainment, but we want to design a game that also incorporates critical thinking and proper strategizing in order to clear each level. As gaming is what we both enjoy, we are very interested in picking up game development to challenge ourselves this summer and create an intuitive and challenging game for our players.

## Aim 

We hope to make a turn-based strategy game that is both entertaining and engaging. We hope that this game allows our players to stretch their minds and think of creative ways and different strategies to overcome the challenges in each level of our game.

## User Stories

- As a player, the goal of the game is to clear the dungeon and defeat the final boss at the end.
- As a player, they can clear each stage and collect the characters along the way.
- As a player, they can come up with different strategies and routes to clear each stage with the different classes and skills of our playable characters.
- As a game developer who wants to learn about the way users play the game, I want to be able to identify the strategies players use in order to clear each stage.

# SCOPE
We are creating a Turn-based strategy game, similar to games like Fire Emblem. Our players control a variety of characters  with different skills, with the goal of clearing the different stages that we create with their own creative strategies.

The game consists of 8 levels in total, 3 normal stages(city) and 1 mini-boss stage(ufo fight), followed by another 3 stages(inside ufo) and the final boss(the boss alien). We have 6 classes to choose from, in each stage users select 3 classes to attempt to clear the stage. Each class will have 3 different abilities, 2 basic abilities and 1 special ability that needs to be charged.
